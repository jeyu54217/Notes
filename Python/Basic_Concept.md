## Dynamic Typing

# Mutable & Immutable
## Immutable
```python
x = (1,2,3)
3 in x # True
x[0] = "change me!" # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
# Tuple
faster than lists
safer
Valid keys in a dictionary ex .items() 
2 methods
.count() Returns the number of times a value appears in a tuple

# Set

Sets do not have duplicate values
Elements in sets aren't ordered.
You cannot access items in a set by index.
Sets can be useful if you need to keep track of a collection of elements, but don't care about ordering, keys or values and duplicates
