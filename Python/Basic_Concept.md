```python
x = (1,2,3)
3 in x # True
x[0] = "change me!" # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Tuple
1. ligh-weight lists : faster and safer than lists
2. Valid keys in a dictionary ex .items() 
3. Only 2 Methods : 
3-1. a..count(), 
# Set

1. Sets do not have duplicate values
2. Elements in sets aren't ordered.
3. You cannot access items in a set by index.
