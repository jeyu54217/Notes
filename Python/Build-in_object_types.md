# Core Data Types (Core bvuilt-in objects)

1. Numeric Types:
   - `int`: Represents integers, e.g., 5, -10, 1000.
   - `float`: Represents floating-point numbers with decimal places, e.g., 3.14, -2.5.
   - `complex`: Represents complex numbers in the form `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are floats.

2. Sequence Types:
   - `str`: Represents strings of characters, e.g., "Hello, World!".
   - `list`: Represents ordered, mutable sequences, e.g., [1, 2, 3].
   - `tuple`: Represents ordered, immutable sequences, e.g., (1, 2, 3).

3. Mapping Type:
   - `dict`: Represents key-value pairs, also known as dictionaries, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}.

4. Set Types:
   - `set`: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements, e.g., {1, 2, 3}.
   - `frozenset`: Represents an immutable version of a set.

5. Boolean Type:
   - `bool`: Represents boolean values `True` and `False`.

6. None Type:
   - `None`: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

7. Binary Types:
   - `bytes`: Represents sequences of bytes, e.g., `b'hello'`.
   - `bytearray`: Represents mutable sequences of bytes.

8. Range Type:
   - `range`: Represents a sequence of numbers, commonly used in for-loops, e.g., `range(5)`.

9. Program unit Types:
   - `Functions`: Represents complex numbers in the form `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are floats.
   - `classes`: The base class for all Python objects.
   - `modules`: Represents the type of an object, e.g., `type(5)` returns `<class 'int'>`.
10. Implementation-related types
   - Compiled code, stack tracebacks
