# Network Scope
## PAN (Personal Area Network)
  -  A network formed around a person
  -  e.g. cordless mice, keyboards, Bluetooth systems.
### Pros.
  - secure & safe
  - It offers only short-range solution up to 10 meters
### Cons.
  - Should be in the same radio bands.
  - Distance limits.
## LAN (Local Area Network)
  -  a group of computer which are connected in a limited area such as school, laboratory, office building or a printer in someone’s home
  -  For sharing resources like files, printers, games, and other application. 
  -  Consists of less than **5000** interconnected devices across several buildings.
### Pros.
  - File sharing
      - hard-disks, DVD-ROM, and printers can share local area networks. This significantly reduces the cost of hardware purchases.
      - You can use the same software over the network instead of purchasing the licensed software for each client in the network.
      - Data of all network users can be stored on a single hard disk of the server computer.
      - You can easily transfer data and messages over networked computers.
      - It will be easy to manage data at only one place, which makes data more secure.
### Cons.
  - Initial cost : the initial cost of installing Local Area Networks is quite high.
  - Privacy : The LAN admin can check personal data files of every LAN user, so it does not offer good privacy.
  - Unauthorized users can access critical data of an organization in case LAN admin is not able to secure centralized data repository.
  -  requires a constant LAN administration as there are issues related to software setup and hardware failures

## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  -  a computer network across an entire city, college campus, or a small region. 
  -  This type of network is large than a LAN, which is mostly limited to a single building or site. 
  -  It mostly covers towns and cities in a maximum 50 km range
  -  Mostly used medium is optical fibers, cables.

### Pros.
  - It offers fast communication using high-speed carriers, like fiber optic cables.
  - It provides excellent support for an extensive size network and greater access to WANs.
### Cons.
  - You need more cable to establish MAN connection from one place to another.
  - In MAN network it is tough to make the system secure from hackers
## WAN (Wide Area Network)
  - spread across a large geographical area such as small towns, cities 
  - Could be a connection of a LAN which connects with other LAN’s using telephone lines and radio waves
  - It is mostly limited to an enterprise or an organization.
  - The software files will be shared among all the users; therefore, all can access to the latest files.
  - Any organization can form its global integrated network using WAN.
### Pros.
  - business offices situated at longer distances can easily communicate.
  - Contains devices like mobile phones, laptop, tablet, computers, gaming consoles
  - WLAN connections work using radio transmitters and receivers built into client devices.
### Cons.
  - The initial setup cost of investment is very high.
  - It is difficult to maintain the WAN network. You need skilled technicians and network administrators.
  - There are more errors and issues because of the wide coverage and the use of different technologies.
  - It requires more time to resolve issues because of the involvement of multiple wired and wireless technologies.
  - Offers lower security compared to other types of network in computer.
